Must-haves:
Front page CSS
    Snow effects
Response page CSS
    Music?
        With a delay?

Nice-to-haves:
Encrypt DB giftingTo column
Admin - Secure endpoints (Google oauth?)
Admin - Generate messages to send to people
Move input data out from the input.ts file
Move away from family-based restriction to person-based restrictions

Wishful thinking:
Accessed by table, record all requests for statistics
Google Calendar event download
Email reminder with the gift recipient (code) X amount of days before
    Include link to Google Doc
Add a public key for signing
    Enter private key on website to decrypt
        Decryption only in the browser, no sending the key to API
    Allow download of encrypted string for decrypt outside of browser
DigiDoc encryption!
Nonce generation for the front page form
Add CORS to API
Add "Show/hide password" button
